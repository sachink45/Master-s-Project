## Project Title: Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for Student Health Prediction

## Overview:
This project focuses on leveraging Artificial Intelligence, specifically the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (FLS), to enhance our understanding and address health issues among students. Recognizing the crucial link between health and academic performance, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis using Python and Pandas to scrutinize a dataset. Subsequently, we employed both machine learning and fuzzy logic techniques to predict the health status of students.

## Methodology:
The approach encompasses the utilization of five distinct health prediction models: Type-1 Fuzzy Logic learning from the data, Type-1 Fuzzy Logic with auto rules generation (traditional fuzzy rules-based system), Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic learning from the data, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic with auto rule generation through experimentation, and a Machine Learning model.

## Results:
After applying these models, the findings revealed that the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, renowned for its superior handling of uncertainty, outperformed other models in accurately predicting student health. Surprisingly, the Machine Learning model delivered the lowest accuracy, emphasizing the efficacy of fuzzy logic systems in health predictions.

## Conclusion and Future Work:
These promising results underscore the potential of employing Fuzzy Logic Systems, particularly Interval Type-2, in health prediction systems. The next steps involve refining the use of this AI technology and exploring its combination with other techniques to further enhance predictive accuracy and usability. The overarching objective is to provide critical insights into health trends among students, inform strategies for improving their overall well-being, and thereby enhance academic performance.
